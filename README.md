# Random project with dogs

## Description
This project leverages the [DogAPI](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch for a random dog image each time the page is loaded. The idea behind this is to ramp back up on basic REST queries as well as React since it's been a little while since I've worked extensively with React.
